Elliana Gonzales is a prime representation of young, career driven workers in different professional industries. Motivated by performance and financial goals in their journey along their respective career ladders, these people have little to no spare time as most of their day is focused on completing work tasks and meeting deadlines. Subsequently, people such as Miss Gonzales spend most of their time interacting with personal devices such as laptops and smartphones for either work or personal use, thus leading to their eyes being exposed to long periods of screen time, or developing certain aches and pains if a healthy posture is not adopted during device usage.  

To avoid long term health issues or to prevent themselves from experiencing discomforts, workers like Miss Gonzales often seek out methods to improve their daily habits. Such methods can be represented in many ways, either by limiting device usage as to minimize eye exposure to screens, having timely reminders to practice healthy posturers and habits, obtain rewards for following healthy living habits and so on .Due to this and the large numbers of professional workers in the present day,this group is anticipated to be a major audience to the shepard project.
