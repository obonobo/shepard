Being a renowned architect and interior designer, Etienne Barsotti is a perfect example of an established professional with specialized skills honed across years of practice. Having a large number of followers on Instagram and Pinterest, Mr. Barsotti is highly dependent on social media as a platform to showcase his work, or to voice his thoughts in the form of blog posts. Besides allowing him to display his work for his followers to view, his social media and personal website may also attract potential employers and business partners for future partnerships. 

Yet specialized workers such as Mr. Barsotti need to manage multiple social media accounts in addition to their usual work (which already has them facing screens throughout the day). Thus , a prolonged exposure to screens may end up bringing negative effects on oneâ€™s work performance for reasons such as eye fatigue or migraine. As such, users such as Mr. Barsotti can benefit from a screen time regulator app such as the Shepard SuperApp, which can ensure they are practicing healthy screen habits, and subsequently maintain maximum work performance.
