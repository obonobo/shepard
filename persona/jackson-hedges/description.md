Sporting a lucrative and vibrant career as a content creator, Jackson Hedge often finds himself making crucial decisions between his work and personal life. Mr. Hedge's work requires a steady delivering of content to his platform (e.g., YouTube) to ensure satisfaction among his viewers, and to attract new audiences. Furthermore, managing an online content delivery platform is often a tedious process, requiring a range of different tasks such as video editing, sound design or even collaboration planning with other creators. As a result, individuals such as Mr. Hedge are often too swamped with such tasks, and may spend less time interacting with loved ones and family. 

Individuals such as Mr. Hedges are common in modern times, where professional work and career often overtake and personal lives, creating invisible riffs in relationships where there once was closeness, leaving many once warm and happy relationships a cold shell of their former selves. Luckily, situations like those can be avoided in many ways. Perhaps all one needs is a gentle reminder put aside work, and spend time with those they cherish and love. A reminder that the Shepard Project intends on bringing to people such as Mr. Hedge.
