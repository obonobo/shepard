## Project Description

The world is changing. Technology has revolutionized the way we live - the time
that people spend in front of screens has risen and risen with no end in sight;
work, school, and entertainment are now almost universally situated within the
realm of technology. In many ways, our lives are easier than ever... But in all
this speed and progress, the human element can easily get lost.

New research has shown the damage that excessive screen time can cause to the
mental and social well-being of an individual. It is now clear that our
relationship to technology requires a more nuanced approach. Healthy living
means limiting our time in front of screens; it means engaging in exercise and
spending time with family.

Shepard is a super app that promotes healthy living. The Shepard app ecosystem
provides encouragement to the user that steers them towards living a healthy
lifestyle. One of the big problems that Sheperd tackles is how to help users
manage their screen time. In this vein, the desktop and mobile apps on the
Shepard platform offer features for enforcing healthy screen habits, such as
timers, notifications, and task management. Shepard also offers functionality
for promoting health exercise habits.
